## 1. Introduction

- A significant amount of data is generated as well as being made available to internet users thanks to the development and growth of online technologies. The internet has developed into a forum for online education, idea sharing, and opinion exchange. Social networking services like Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ are quickly gaining popularity as a result of the ability for users to share and express their opinions on many subjects, engage in conversation with various communities, and broadcast messages globally.The study of sentiment in Twitter data has received a lot of attention.
- The major aim of this project is sentiment analysis of twitter data, which is useful for analyzing information in tweets when opinions are very unstructured, varied, and occasionally neutral. In this project, we present a comparative analysis, assessment metrics, and existing methods for opinion mining, such as lexicon-based methods and machine learning methods. We present research on twitter data streams using a variety of machine learning methods, including Bernoulli Naive Bayes, SVM (Support Vector Machine), Logistic Regression, and Neural Network.

## 3. Dataset

- This is the sentiment140 dataset. It contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the twitter api . The tweets have been annotated (0 = negative, 4 = positive) and they can be used to detect sentiment.
- dataset: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140>

## 4. Data Pre-processing

A tweet includes numerous perspectives about the data that are presented by various people in various ways. The Twitter dataset utilized in this study is already divided into two categories, negative and positive polarity, making it simple to perform a sentiment analysis on the data and see how different variables affect sentiment. Polarity in the raw data makes it particularly prone to redundancy and inconsistency.
Preprocessing of datasets and tweet include following points:

- Removing unused features from the dataset.
- Removing stopwords from tweets using NLTK. 
- Removing punctuations from the tweets.
- Removing repeating characters from the tweets. 
- Removing URLâ€™s from the tweets.
- Removing numbers from the tweets.
